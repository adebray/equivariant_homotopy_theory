Note: as much of the class will be in Regensburg for a conference next week, there will be no class next Tuesday or
Thursday.

Today, we'll continue to discuss operadic multiplication on $G\Top$ and $\Spc^G$. The goal is to figure out what
the right notion of a multiplicative $\RO(G)$-graded cohomology theory is --- in the nonequivariant case, ring
spectra are the objects that represent multiplicative cohomology theories, and we want to discover the equivariant
analogue.

Operadic multiplication is one way to approach this, an algebraic (or infinite loop space) approach to this by
thinking of $\Spc^G$ as algebras in spaces.

In the nonequivariant case, $\Omega^\infty$ defines an equivalence between connective spectra and grouplike
$E_\infty$-spaces ($X$ is \term{grouplike} if $\pi_0(X)$ is a group). These are spaces that have homotopy coherent
abelian group structures, and is a fancy way of saying that spectra behave like abelian groups. We want to do this
equivariantly, and the big question therein is: \emph{how do we operadically encode transfers?}

Let's first recall what's going on in the nonequivariant case. We'll think of connective spectra as \term{infinite
loop spaces}: if $X$ is an $\Omega$-spectrum, $X_0 \cong \Omega X_1 \cong \Omega^2 X_2 \cong \dotsb$, and therefore
is an $n$-fold loop space for all $n$.

We want to recognize $n$-fold loop spaces: how do you know when $X\simeq\Omega^n Y$ for some $Y$? One way to
approach this is to define a delooping construction $B$, and be able to use it $n$ times. Beck (of Barr-Beck fame)
provided an answer: $(\Sigma^n, \Omega^n)$ define an adjunction $\Top\rightleftarrows\Top$, whose associated
comonad is $\Sigma^n\Omega^n$ and whose associated monad is $\Omega^n\Sigma^n$.

What Beck observed is that if $X = \Omega^n Y$, $X$ admits an action of the monad $\Omega^n\Sigma^n$:
\[\xymatrix{
	\Omega^n\Sigma^n (\Omega^n Y) = \Omega^n (\Sigma^n\Omega^n) Y\ar[r]^-\eta &\Omega^n Y,
}\]
where $\eta\colon\Sigma^n\Omega^n\to\id$ is the counit of the adjunction.
\begin{thm}[Beck]
If $B(\Sigma^m, \Omega^n\Sigma^n, \Omega^n Y)$ is the simplicial bar construction, i.e.\ the simplicial space
\[[q]\mapsto (\Sigma^m)(\Omega^n\Sigma^n)\Omega^n Y,\]
then its geometric realization is equivalent to $\Omega^{n-m}Y$:
\[\abs{B(\Sigma^m, \Omega^n\Sigma^n, \Omega^n Y)}\simeq \Omega^{n-m}Y.\]
\end{thm}
This recognition principle is nice: it means that if $Z$ is any algebra over $\Omega^n\Sigma^n$, then $Z$ is an
$n$-fold loop space. Great! Except that we don't know any $\Omega^n\Sigma^n$-algebras other than $\Omega^n Y$: they
don't arise in nature.

Boardman-Vogt and May realized it's convenient to work with operads $C_n$ such that there's a map of monads from
$\overline C_n\to\Omega^n\Sigma^n$.
\begin{defn}
Let $O$ be an operad. Then, $\overline O$ denotes the associated monad
\[X\mapsto\bigvee_n O(n)\times_{\Sigma_n} X^n.\]
\end{defn}
The point is that algebras for the monad $\overline O$ are the same thing as algebras for the operad $O$, but the
monadic category is easier to deal with. For example, you can use this construction to show that $\Alg_O$ is
complete and cocomplete under mild hypotheses on $O$.
\begin{exm}
The \term{little $n$-cubes operad} $C$ is the operad such that $C_n(m)$ is the space of configurations of $m$
disjoint closed cubes in an $n$-dimensional cube. There is a map $\overline C_n\to\Omega^n\Sigma^n$ which arises
from an action of $\overline C_n$ on
\[C_n(m)\times (\Omega^n X)^m\to \Omega^n X\]
The idea\footnote{\TODO: I don't understand this.} is, given $m$ $n$-cubes inside a big $n$-cube, crush the
boundary of each cube to a point, and send everything outside the little cubes to the basepoint. It's not too hard
to write this out explicitly.
\end{exm}
This is a fattened-up version of a configuration space, and so the topology of $C_n(m)$ is already very interesting
(and why the little $n$-cubes operad can be used to define $E_n$-algebras).

Now, given a connected $C_n$-space $X$, it's possible to deloop through the bar construction:
\[\xymatrix{
	X & B(C_n,C_n,X)\ar[l]_-\simeq\ar[r]^-{\theta_1} & B(\Omega^n\Sigma^n, C_n, X)\ar[r]^-{\theta_2} &\Omega^n
	B(\Sigma^n, C_n, X).
}\]
The map $B(C_n,C_n, X)\to X$ is the easy part: it's an equivalence by standard methods, and should be thought of as
the free $C_n$-resolution of $X$. The map $\theta_1$ comes from the map $C_n\to\Omega_n\Sigma_n$, and is an
equivalence. But $\theta_2$ is hard: it's a theorem that geometric realization commutes with homotopy limits in
this context, and uses the fact that $X$ is connected. But the point is, with all this setup, $C_n$-algebras can be
delooped. This approach is studied in~\cite{MayGILS}.

Now, taking the sequential colimit along $C_n\to C_{n+1}\to\dotsb$, we get an $E_\infty$-operad whose algebras are
called \term{$E_\infty$-spaces}.
\begin{defn}
An operad $O$ is an \term{$E_\infty$-operad} if $O(n)$ is contractible for all $n$ and $\Sigma_n$ acts freely on
each $O(n)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
If $X$ is an $E_\infty$-space and $\pi_0(X)$ is a group, then $X\cong\Omega^\infty Z$ for a spectrum $Z$.
\end{thm}
That is, we can deloop $X$ arbitrarily many times. This is the classical way to understand infinite loop spaces.

Suppose $f\colon O\to O'$ is a map of operads. Then, we get functors between algebras in both directions: there's a
pubblack $f^*\colon\Top[O']\to\Top[O]$ and a \term{change of scalars} operad $B(O',O,\bl)\colon\Top[O]\to\Top[O']$;
the bar construction model for this is a nice thing to have around.

When do these induce an equivalence on the categories of algebras? The answer for $E_\infty$-operads,
is when $f_n\colon O(n)\to O'(n)$ is a (nonequivariant) equivalence.\footnote{The \term{commutative operad}, for
which $O(n) = *$ for all $n$, parameterizes commutative algebras, and it's not $E_\infty$! This is a source of much
frustration; for example, it's the reason that you generally have to use a different model structure on categories
of commutative ring spectra.} But there's always a map, given by the push-pull construction on
\[\xymatrix@dr{
	O\times O'\ar[r]\ar[d] & O'.\\
	O
}\]
So it really doesn't matter which $E_\infty$-operad you use.
\subsection*{The equivariant case.} What does this look like equivariantly? Last time (\cref{ninfty}), we defined
$N_\infty$-operads to be those for which $O(0)\simeq *$, the $\Sigma_n$-action on $O(n)$ is free, and $O(n)\simeq
E\sF_n$ for some family $\sF_n$ of $G\times\Sigma_n$ that contains $H\times\set 1$.

We're going to show that algebras for an $N_\infty$-operad $O$ in $\Top$ will correspond to some kinds of $G$-spectrum
with transfer structures by $\set{\sF_n}$. If $O = \mathcal L_U$ (the linear isometries operad in \cref{Gopexm}),
then we get $G$-spectra dictated by the universe $U$, but these are not the only examples.

This leaves a few questions.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Why do we get transfer maps? How can we see this from the operadic structure?
	\item What can we say about the collection $\set{\sF_n}$? You can't just pick any of them: they have
	complicated interrelationships.
\end{enumerate}
Looking at the second question, suppose $\Gamma\subset G\times\Sigma_n$ is such that $\Gamma\cap\paren{\set
1\times\Sigma_n} = \set 1$. We proved in \cref{admlem} that this is equivalent to $\Gamma$ being the graph of a
homomorphism $\rho\colon H\to\Sigma_n$, which is equivalent to the data of an $H$-set of cardinality $n$. We called
such $H$-sets admissible.
\begin{defn}
Let $\cat{Cat}$ denote the category of small categories and functors, and $\operatorname{\otimes\cat{Cat}}$ denote
the category of small symmetric monoidal categories and strong monoidal functors.
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \term{categorical coefficient system} is a functor $\sO_G\op\to\cat{Cat}$.
	\item A \term{symmetric monoidal categorical coefficient system} is a functor
	$\sO_G\op\to\operatorname{\otimes\cat{Cat}}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{exm}
The most important example is $\underline\Set$, the functor sending $G/H\mapsto H\Set$, the category whose objects
are $H$-sets, morphisms are $H$-maps, and monoidal product is disjoint union. $\underline\Set$ is a symmetric
monoidal categorical coefficient system.

Similarly, $\underline\Top$ denotes the functor sending $G/H\mapsto H\Top$, with monoidal product disjoint union.
This is also a symmetric monoidal categorical coefficient system.
\end{exm}
\begin{lem}
Let $\set{\sF_n}$ be a collection of families of subgroups of $G$. Then, $\set{\sF_n}$ arises from an
$N_\infty$-operad iff it's a sub symmetric monoidal coefficient system of $\underline\Set$.\footnote{\TODO: did I
get this right?}
\end{lem}
That is, these are exactly the functors sending $G/H$ to admissible $H$-sets.
\begin{defn}
An \term{indexing system} $\underline I$ is a sub symmetric monoidal coefficient system of $\underline\Top$ which
is
\begin{enumerate}
	\item closed under self-induction,
	\item closed under Cartesian product,
	\item closed under passage to self-objects, and
	\item contains all trivial sets.
\end{enumerate}
Here, \term{self-induction} means that if $H/K\in\underline I(H)$ and $T\in\underline I(K)$, then $H\times_K
T\in\underline I(H)$.
\end{defn}
These axioms appear somewhat arbitrary, but there's a nice categorical description in terms of bispans, and we'll
talk about it next time.
\begin{defn}
Let $O$ be an $N_\infty$-operad, so that it defines a collection of families $\set{\sF_n}$ of subgroups of $G$.
Let $\underline O$ denote the functor sending $G/H$ to the collection of admissible $H$-sets for $\set{\sF_n}$.
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}
\label{Ninfind}
Let $O$ be an $N_\infty$-operad; then, $\underline O$ is an indexing system.
\end{prop}
We say that a map $f\colon O\to O'$ of $N_\infty$-operads is a \term{homotopy equivalence} if it defines a
$G\times\Sigma_n$-homotopy equivalence $O(n)\to O'(n)$ for all $n$.
\begin{thm}
The assignment $O\mapsto\underline O$ is a fully-faithful embedding from the homotopy category of
$N_\infty$-operads to the poset of indexing systems.
\end{thm}
\begin{ques}
Is this embedding an equivalence of categories? This question is currently open. Certainly, the naïve ideas for
what the functor in the opposite direction could be are wrong.
\end{ques}
\begin{proof}[Partial proof of \cref{Ninfind}]
It's clear that trivial sets are admissible for an $N_\infty$-operad $O$.\footnote{As a corollary, this means that
if $O$ is an $N_\infty$-operad, then $i_e^*O$ is an $E_\infty$-operad, where $i_e\colon\Top\to G\Top$ prescribes
the trivial action.}

We want to show that $\underline O$ is closed under coproduct: if $S$ and $T$ are admissible $H$-sets, we'd like
for $S\amalg T$ to be admissible. Well, $S$ is the graph of a $p_S\colon H\to\Sigma_{\abs S}$ and $T$ is the graph
of $P_T\colon H\to\Sigma_{\abs T}$. Let $\Gamma_S$ be the associated subgroup of $G\times\Sigma_{\abs S}$, and
define $\Gamma_T$ in the same way.

Let
\[\Gamma\coloneqq \set{(h, p_S(h)\amalg p_T(h))\mid h\in H}.\]
This acts on $S\amalg T$, and gives it the structure of an admissible $H$-set. Given the map
\[O(2)\times O(\abs S)\times O(\abs T)\longrightarrow O(\abs S + \abs T),\]
we'd like to show that the $\Gamma$-fixed point set of $O(\abs S + \abs T)$ is nonempty. But by hypothesis,
$(O(2)\times O(\abs S)\times O(\abs T)^\Gamma$ is nonempty, so we're done.

The pattern of proof is the same for the rest of the conditions.
\end{proof}
We've been talking about transfers, so let's see why algebras over an $N_\infty$-operad have transfers.

Let $T$ be an admissible $H$-set. Then, the space of maps
\[G\times\Sigma_{\abs T}/\Gamma_T\longrightarrow O(\abs T)\]
is contractible.
\begin{lem}
\[(G\times\Sigma_{\abs T}/\Gamma_T)\times_{\Sigma_{\abs T}} X^{\abs T} \cong G\times_H F(T,X).\]
\end{lem}
% ???
Thus, if $X$ is an algebra over an $N_\infty$-operad $O$, we have maps
\[\xymatrix{
	G\times_H F(T,X)\ar[r] & (G\times\Sigma_{\abs T}/\Gamma_T)\times\Sigma_{\abs T} X^{\abs T}\ar[r] & O(\abs
	T)\times_{\Sigma_{\abs T}} X^{\abs T}\ar[r] & X,
}\]
and this is where the transfer maps on $\pi_0(X)$ come from.

If $X$ is a $G$-space and $T$ is an $H$-set, let
\[N^TX\coloneqq G\times_H F(T, i_H^*X).\]
\begin{lem}
A map $S\to T$ of $H$-sets induces a map $N^S X\to N^T X$.
\end{lem}
The proof is the same as for the construction of the transfer maps $H/K\to H/H$: build this transfer, and then
induce up. In general, an $H$-map $S\to T$ induces a map
\[F(T, i_H^*X)\longrightarrow F(S, i_H^*X).\]
Passing to fixed points and taking $\pi_0$, this is precisely a system of transfers on $\pi_0$.
\begin{rem}
One consequence of this is a conceptual description of the double coset formula: the restriction to $K'$ of a
transfer on $T$ is just the transfer on $i_{K'}T$. We'll unpack this next time.
\end{rem}
Another conceptual takeaway is that $N_\infty$-operads are the right way to discuss transfers in the equivariant
setting. So we may as well port them to $G$-spectra, since they're also enriched over $G$-spaces. But when you do
this, you stumble upon one of the basic conundrums of equivariant homotopy theory.

Let $X$ be a space. Then, $X^n$ is a $C^n$-space, where $C_n$ acts by permuting the factors. The diagonal map
$\Delta\colon X\to X^n$ induces an equivalence $X\cong (X^n)^{C_n}$. The problem is to do this with spectra: we
want a map $\Sp\to\Sp^{C_n}$ such that we have a diagonal.

The naïve approach is to send $X\mapsto X^{\wedge n}$, but what universe does $X^{\wedge n}$ live in? Naïvely,
we're in $U^n$, which maps back down to $U$. But in $U^n$, we have good fixed-point behavior for representations of
the form $(V,V,\dotsc,V)$ --- and only for representations of this form. So it's not clear how to make this work.

Bökstedt's construction of $\mathit{THH}$ needed something like this, and so Bökstedt did the minimal amount
necessary to get something to work. The technical solution to this uses ideas from group cohomology, specifically
the \term{Evans norm}. And figuring out how to make this work was one of the important new ideas in~\cite{HHR}.

We'll eventually get to ring spectra and spectra with norm maps, which encode a kind of twisted multiplication.
